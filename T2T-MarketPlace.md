## Full Stack Project - T2T Marketplace - Secondhand Trading Website

**Project description:**

The T2T Marketplace is a secondhand trading website aimed at providing a faster and more secure platform for online transactions. Unlike existing thrift stores like eBay, Facebook Marketplace, and Craigslist, which have a broader user base but also introduce uncertainties due to anonymous transactions, our project emphasizes real-name registration and login to enhance user credibility. Additionally, as the platform targets UNC students, it reduces the inconvenience caused by distance and facilitates face-to-face product delivery, enabling more timely feedback.

### 2. Innovative Approach

This project leverages the T3 app, a powerful full-stack development platform that enables developers to create scalable and high-performing applications effortlessly. Alongside the T3 app, we employ the Next.js framework, which revolutionizes the traditional front-end and back-end connection paradigm. By utilizing Next.js features such as API routes, server-side rendering, and static generation, our platform delivers exceptional performance, scalability, and flexibility. With the combination of the T3 app and Next.js, we provide dynamic content updates and enhance the overall user experience while maintaining developer flexibility and productivity.

### 3. UI Design

To streamline our frontend development process and create an efficient ecommerce platform, we have integrated Tailwind CSS and Redux Toolkit.

### 4. Used Tool

- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript
- PostgreSQL
- Redux Toolkit
- React
- Next.js Framework
- Prisma
- Vercel
- Cloundary

### 5. Go Live / Deployment

To ensure the smooth operation of our online shopping platform, we are implementing a reliable and cost-effective Go-live and Server-maintenance system. Our platform is currently hosted on VERCEL, and we believe that this system will allow us to minimize downtime and provide our customers with a seamless online shopping experience.

To ensure the reliability and availability of our platform, we will implement a Go-live strategy that includes rolling deployment and A/B testing. We will also set up an automated Server-maintenance system that includes performance monitoring, log analysis, and alerts for potential issues.
